#### Using a Local Beam Search to solve the 8 Queens Problem

-----

#### History
The original solution to this problem was attempted in the 8Queens.py file. That file however, had a bug inside at least the metric evalution function.

Since then I have redone the problem. The working (and correct) solution is inside the "K-Beam Search of 8 Queens.py" file.
The file will be using a simplified version where the board is collapsed into a 1-d array. e.g. b = [5, 1, 3, 2, 4, 0, 7, 6] OR 51345076

This corrected version was inspired by Damian Lyons (my professor for Artificial Intelligence in Fordham's CS Grad School).
